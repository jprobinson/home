# Global Context

Personal preferences:
- Use the `gh` command to interact with GitHub. If not installed, use the instructions here: https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian
- Whenever you create a branch, prefix it with `jprobinson/`
- Ask me if there's a Jira ticket before creating a PR. If we have one, include it in the PR messaging, save space in the title. Formatted as '[MYTIX-123]
